Welcome to my PHP login responsive website repository! This repository contains the code for a PHP-based login system with a responsive design.

## PhpMyAdmin Database:
The Mysql database name is "login". (without parentheses)

## Login Page Screenshot:

The login page allows users to sign in to their accounts after registering account.

## Welcome Page Screenshot:

After successful login, users are redirected to the welcome page, where they get a welcome message on screen.
The log out button will log out the account.
